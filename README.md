Physiolibrary.models
====================

A set of cardiovascular models in Modelica and extension libraries based on [http://www.physiolibrary.org] v2.3.1 including supporting scripts for generating list of initial values.

Currently the circulation hemodynamic models are included based on description and literature made by Burkhoff et al., Meurs et al., Smith and Fernandez et al. and an example of complex combined model by Kalecky.
This model set is a supplementary material to an article *Lumped Models of the Cardiovascular System of Various Complexity* by Filip Ježek, Tomáš Kulhánek, Karel Kalecký and Jiří Kofránek.

Installation
============
Download the model and open in th following order:
  * Physiolibrary/...   from www.physiolibrary.org
  * Cardiovascular/Cardiovascular.mo

Run an example
==============
Run any model with a green Play triangle, e.g. Cardiovascular.Model.Meurs.HemodynamicsMeurs or Cardiovascular.Model.Complex.Cardio. With decomposed models, you can redeclare the submodels wby any other compatible submodel of same subsystem (in Dymola use right context menu - change class - all matching choices - select you choice).
